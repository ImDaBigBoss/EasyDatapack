# EasyDatapack
EasyDatapack is a PaperMC API to create your own datapack easily, but this project does everything through code as opposed to json files and MC functions.

## How do I use it?
**This plugin depends on [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/).** You can download the latest version of it [here](https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/ProtocolLib.jar).<br>
The latest version of the backend can be downloaded on the [releases page](https://github.com/ImDaBigBoss/EasyDatapack/releases). For API updates, make sure you have the correct version number (also visible on the releases page). You can get it as a dependency [like this](https://github.com/ImDaBigBoss/EasyDatapack/wiki/Quick-start:-PaperMC#adding-the-api-as-a-dependency).<br>
All the information you need to create your own datapack can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/ImDaBigBoss/EasyDatapack/wiki).<br>
