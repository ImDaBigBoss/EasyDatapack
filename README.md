# EasyDatapack
EasyDatapack is a PaperMC API to create your own datapack easily, but this project does everything through code as opposed to json files and MC functions.

## How do I use it?
**This plugin depends on [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/).** You can download the latest version of the plugin [here](https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/ProtocolLib.jar).<br>
All the information you need can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/ImDaBigBoss/EasyDatapack/wiki). If you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to ask on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/5n8ttQfSqF).
