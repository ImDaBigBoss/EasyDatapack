# EasyDatapack
EasyDatapack is a PaperMC API to create your own datapack easily, but this project does everything through code as opposed to json files and MC functions.

## How do I use it?
The latest version of the backend can be downloaded on the [releases page](https://github.com/ImDaBigBoss/EasyDatapack/releases). For API updates, make sure you have the correct version number (also visible on the releases page). You can get it as a dependency [like this](https://github.com/ImDaBigBoss/EasyDatapack/wiki/Quick-start:-PaperMC#adding-the-api-as-a-dependency).<br>
All the information you need to create your own datapack can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/ImDaBigBoss/EasyDatapack/wiki).<br>
